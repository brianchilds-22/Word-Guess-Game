# Word-Guess-Game

You start the game by selecting any key. The current word then displays and the player starts guessing letters. 
If the letter is in the word the letter displays under current word, If the letter is not in the word the letter displays under 
letters guessed and it subtracts one from the guesses left display. You win the game if you complete the word with out using all of your
guesses and the game alerts "You got it! the answer is "current word"". The win is calculated and diplayed. You lose the game if you
do not guess the current word within the allowed guesses (6 in this game) the game alerts "the correct answer is "current word"". 
When the user clicks ok to close the alert window the game resets. I attempted to code a "hint" picture where the image of the dinosaur
would match with the current word and used google dev tools to try to iron it out yet couldn't get a working game. I am hoping to be able 
to delete the last sentence and make the "hint" feature work.
